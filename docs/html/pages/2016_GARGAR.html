            <p>Forgotten, hopeless, dim, useless, extra.</p>
            <p>Do you ever feel like Tido Jackson?</p>
            <p>Do you ever feel like a pedestrian in Grand Theft Auto?</p>
            <p>Do you ever feel like the “i” that gets crushed by the lamp in Pixar?</p>
            <p>Do you ever feel like the vosotros form of spanish?</p>
            <p>Do you ever feel like just…. You?</p>
            <p>Upon reflection of my four years spent here at Maeser, I have found that it is pretty easy to see oneself as extra. In the Maeser universe there are so many stars and other breathtaking celestial bodies, it's easy to see yourself as just the space in between them. I submit that this is not true. I might not be the smartest, I might not be the most artistic, I might not be the most athletic, I might not be the most gifted. These are all things that I am not. But everything I am not made me everything I am. The same goes for you too, so own it, because in reality there is no Maeser universe. There are no stars, no space inbetween. There is so much more than that . . . there are PEOPLE. Nothing exists with more power than that of an individual. What a shame it would be if after four years of never knowing why you went this way, or that way, or any way. You could go a long way, but if you never got to know yourself it would be the wrong way.</p>
            <p>What a fascinating group of people. Each person has such a deep pool of experience that is totally unique. Every interaction with someone could easily be taken as just making ripples on the surface of their pool. You would never know that you were actually stirring the deepest depths of their pool. They might not know it either, just give it time. Here are some of the “RIPPLES” made on the surface of my pool: Ever need some motivation to be better? Just watch Logan Norris take the most furious yet calculated steps you have ever seen right down these two hallways. Have you ever needed someone to smile at you? Recollection of the luminous aura of Riley Corrigan cognize in my memory of his legacy. Ever need to be heard? The firm countenance of Mr. Gilbert circuits through my head.</p>
            <p>I can honestly say that I will forever remain grateful to my mother who forced me to sign a contract stating I would attend Maeser Prep for all four years of high school after quitting this pseudo white house after only fourteen days spent in hell . . . or excuse me, the eighth grade. When I signed away the next four years of my life to a school with strange uniforms, strange people, and equally strange teachers, I had no idea that in that blip of a moment, the rest of my entire life would be influenced by that one decision. Maeser has done nothing less than sufficiently fill my pool. Watching everyone grow up right before our very own eyes, Some grew a little more than others *Cough cough Stephon*</p>
            <p>This was a year of lasts and a year of firsts. My last time ever attending back to school stomp, but my first time watching my youngest brother attend his first. My last year not saying hello to you in the hallway on any given day, but the first year I realized that I regretted it. My last year of walking these carpet stained halls, but the first year knowing that the these are the same halls that will stain my memory. My last year of wearing my worn and tattered blazer for all of my high school years and my first year of actually fitting into it. My last year of seeing all these faces and my first year of missing them already. Whether if it is your first year here as a seventh grader, or, shoot, maybe even your first year here as a senior, your third year here as a sophomore, or just your last year at this school. Or maybe it's your second year, your fourth, or your SIXTH year for cryin’ out loud, whatever year for whatever grade you are . . .it doesn’t matter. Don’t let it be the last year you make a ripple.</p>

            <h1>ABC Is Not As Easy As 1, 2, 3</h1>
            <h5>Lia Joo</h5>
            <p>I had spent the whole year interpreting the charade of a language called English. From the first week of school to the last, the amount of time I spent sitting on a cold chair mimicking the foreign sounds my teacher let out of her mouth shortened little by little. By the end of the school year, I saw her back turning away from me more than I saw her face. My teacher had given up on teaching me. So naturally, as a 5 year old, making it to first grade seemed impossible. But my mom told me to be patient and to never quit. Now, it was the last day of kindergarten and the teacher assigned one last assignment. The prompt was to write about anything you felt or learned in the school year so I stuck to the basics: the ABC’s. And no Michael Jackson, they were not as easy as 1,2,3.</p>
            <p>A is for apple.</p>
            <p>B is for before. I didn’t know how to speak english before, but here I am 13 years later, slowly packing my bags and preparing for college.</p>
            <p>Confidence. One of the greatest life lessons I learned from bothering Ms. Ure during her prep period: Be confident and courageous.  Be the person that invites people to eat lunch with them, and always stand up for what is right</p>
            <p>Dream. Dream about everything you want to be and demand no less than that.</p>
            <p>E is for e= mc^2 and I still don't know what that means.</p>
            <p>F is for friends… who do stuff together U is for you and me, but we’re not at U yet so moving on,</p>
            <p>Grades, they’re important but looking back, the greatest opportunities for growth did not come from my GPA, but those opportunities came from meeting good people and building off of each other's greatness.</p>
            <p>High school. It can be also thought of as the highway to hell, but don't worry. The exit is just around the corner so just enjoy the ride.</p>
            <p>Impact.  The impact you make on individuals is a lifelong so make a good impression wherever you go, and be a good influence. The inappropriate things you say to be funny are the things that will keep you up at night in the future.</p>
            <p>JUNIORS!! TAKE THE ACT AS MANY TIMES AS YOU CAN! JUST DO IT.</p>
            <p>K, be KIND. Being Kind is more important than being right. The days that you go out of your way to be kind are the days that gets someone through their day.</p>
            <p>Listen. The best listeners make the best people.</p>
            <p>M is for the mornings where you wake up for school and you just say</p>
            <p>N, nope, not today.</p>
            <p>Opportunities don’t last so seize them when you can like when there is a 3 second pause during a socratic discussion, talk. If you don’t you’ll be stuck on that subject waiting for another 30 minutes.</p>
            <p>Parents, thank you. Thank you for your patience and perseverance.</p>
            <p>Quote. Like the quote that mama joo once said in Kindergarten that kept me going, “Don’t Quit.”</p>
            <p>Remember, everything will be okay and that If it were easy everybody would do it. Remember the good times on the rainy days. Like the day when your dad wore socks with flip flops, maybe that’s just an asian thing? And remember,</p>
            <p>Support each other and each semester, finish strong.</p>
            <p>T. thank you. Its sad to think that the only thing I have to say to the teachers is Thank you after all that they have done, but I say this with every ounce of truth in my body, Thank you.</p>
            <p>U is for U and me, seniors. We did it.</p>
            <p>V, value. Value every person in your life because you don’t know when they will be gone.</p>
            <p>Wrong. Don't be afraid to be wrong. Raise your hand and put yourself out there. Coach Nielsen always said, “When you are uncomfortable, that’s when you are growing”</p>
            <p>Xylophone. Why doesn’t it start with a Z?</p>
            <p>Years. 13 years ago I sat in a cold chair thinking that I would be stuck in Kindergarten forever because I couldn’t speak English, but here I am graduating with the class of 2017 because I conquered the charade of a language called English. Which is how I know,</p>
            <p>Z is for zebra and not for xylophone.</p>

            <h1>GPA Isn't Forever</h1>
            <h5>Abriel Rosenvall</h5>
            <p>If you are a Maeser student, you’ve probably done a couple things just for a grade. I’m sure anyone who has been through sophomore year has pulled all-nighters to finish those socratic projects. I have seen many students in Mr. Ensign’s room after school, trying to nail down those awful chemistry concepts. I’ve been part of that group of kids not paying attention in class, because we’re trying to finish our calculus homework for next period. I remember a group at the whiteout game who were reciting anatomical terms to one another in preparation for their test. And I know we’ve all tried texting friends during the unholy hours of the night to get the notes we missed that day. And for what? A grade. Because pain is temporary. GPA is forever.</p> 
            <p>Have you skipped monthly dinner with your extended family simply because you needed to get your paper done? Did you ever decline going to the basketball game or found your way out of helping someone all because you must maintain your GPA? I know I have.</p>
            <p>I remember a day where I was frantically trying to finish my assigned work for my classes. I constantly glanced at the clock trying to stay true to my estimated homework time schedule. I remember the sound of light footsteps leading up to my bedroom door, followed by the quiet turning of the doorknob. My little brother, Finn, opened the door just wide enough to fit his head through and asked, “Abrie, will you come jump on the trampoline with me?” I didn’t even let him finish his sentence before I yelled at him and I demanded that he leave me alone. I was taken aback, wasn’t I trying to do my best to get good grades? That is what my parents wanted, that’s what my teachers hoped, and that was my goal. I was offended by the fact that he even asked. He became another distraction that I needed to shut out from my life. GPA is forever.</p>
            <p>I can recall another time, when I had the idea to call a friend that I could tell was struggling. I stared at my phone. Their contact was already pulled up, and all I needed to do was press call. But instead of immediately pushing the button, I carefully evaluated the amount of MY time that the call would take, and I thoroughly considered the amount of MY homework I had to get done for the following day. I put down my phone, deciding that my school work and my time was more important than my dear friend that was clearly having a hard time. GPA is forever.</p>
            <p>In retrospect, I can see all the days that I neglected to greet people in the hallway all because I needed to get to my next class to ask the teacher a clarifying question about yesterday's lesson. GPA is forever.</p> 
            <p>I was too selfish to see that my priorities were completely skewed. I refused to take ten minutes to jump on the trampoline with my brother, and I was so sure that I didn’t have any time to check in with my friend. Powerschool had taken me as a slave, I lived for the temporary satisfaction of a good grade, and my GPA was in control of my life.</p>
            <p>Now I am not trying to say that school isn’t important. Value your education, but please, do not let your desire to get an A on a test, project, or paper EVER take priority over maintaining the special relationships you have with people.</p> 
            <p>Letting go of those couple extra points is worth building those friendships and making memories. One day I’ll forget those math assignments I never did (sorry Mr. Watabe), but I will remember going to multiple concerts on school nights with Hayden Webb and Sam Garrison. I don’t remember if I passed that test, but I will remember the love I felt after everytime I decided to stay and talk to my friends for the couple more minutes that turned into hours. And I no longer care about what paper I was writing, because jumping on the trampoline with Finn was so much more fun. GPA was forever.</p>
            <p>The good relationships that you will build in high school will last so much longer than the simple three digit number that tries to define you.</p>
            <p>GPA is not forever, but the relationships that you work to build with people can be.</p>

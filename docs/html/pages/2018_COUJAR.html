            <p>Mr. Rogers said, “The world needs a sense of worth.” That is something that we really chase at Maeser. We want to know what’s true and what’s not, which principles are worth building our lives around. We look at centuries old text because we want to find those things that are of worth.</p>
            <p>He continued that quote saying, “and [the world] will achieve it only by its people feeling that they are worthwhile.” That is exactly what makes Maeser, Maeser. Not that we all constantly feel that we are worthwhile, but that it is a priority to each student that their classmates feel that they are worthwhile. Sometimes that looks like students huddled around a crying girl in the hall, sometimes it looks like little origami stars passing from one hand to another.</p>
            <p>I want to say thank you. Thank you for every smile and “hello” in the hallway, for every hug when I needed one (group or otherwise), for every time you clapped when I shared an essay in class or when I walked in late. Thank you for your love.</p>
            <p>My high school experience was nothing like I expected. I expected eight classes, lots of volleyball, hours of homework every night, and a job or a car. Instead, only a few months into high school, my schedule had been whittled down to only two classes everyday, I was physically incapable of even trying out for the volleyball team, and I was sleeping over twenty hours every day.</p>
            <p>However, looking back at the past four years of my life, I wouldn’t trade my difficult experiences at Maeser for the ones I had anticipated and hoped for at any other school, and that is because of each of you.</p>
            <p>Senior Socratic has been one of my best memories and experiences due to the way we have learned to treat one another. We are, for the most part, still the same kids we were in Middle School. But, somewhere along the road, the crazy competition of life became a team sport.</p>
            <p>My advice is to all the students who will be here next year is open up and to begin trusting your peers, and to treat them like they matter. As cool as some kid may seem, two years down the road you may learn that this was the worst year of his life. Or you’ll learn the girl you’ve been so intimidated by looks up to you.</p>
            <p>If you are hurting, say something. I spent a lot of high school feeling like I didn’t fit. During an essay activity in class I ended up sharing this my senior year. My peers cried with me, and I fit perfectly inside the group hug I didn’t know I needed.</p> 
            <p>When someone else is hurting, let them know you care. The best thing you can get out of Maeser isn’t the enlarged vocabulary or the literary canon, but the experiences you get from treating the people in your class like they matter.</p>

            <h1>Done Goof</h1>
            <h5>Patrick Madden</h5>

	        <p>Before I begin I would just like to say thank you to all of the incredible teachers and other staff here at Maeser. You have all been so wonderful to me. Even those that I’ve never had. I found that the easiest way to describe how I feel was said by Glen Phillips, “I often feel like the prodigal son, take all I need, giving back none.” There are too many times for me to count when I have been shown great kindness and love from the people of this school. So once again, thanks to everyone in the school, students and faculty alike. Now to my advice.</p>
            <p>Answer that. Work on it now. Get to sleep early. Wake up before seven o’clock when you live fifteen minutes away from Maeser. Don’t repeat the annoying comment that wasn’t funny the first time—you should have realized that when nobody laughed. Stop trying to be cool. Don’t say “I think it’s in my locker” when you mean “I didn’t do it”. Don’t say “I didn’t do it” when you know that you infact have “done it”. Do talk to the person next to you in any if not all of your classes. Do try extracurricular activities even when you think that you won’t have the time, or money, or skill, or perhaps even a desire to participate in an activity. Do ask the girl out even if you are completely sure that she will say no and your friends will lambaste you and then her friends will jeer at you and then the whole school will then point you out and whisper the words nerd and dingus as you walk through the halls. Do learn to shoot and pass and dribble and chip and perhaps even putt with both hands, or feet, because that will make you an invaluable player in soccer or basketball, and perhaps even golf. Do go running through the forest. Do stand in the wind on the edge of the mountains. Do swim in the lake even when it’s february and you can only stay in it for the some-odd forty-five seconds it takes you to come up gasping and waddling towards the bank to escape its icy clutches. Do not take the small, though ever present, miracles that happen all around you for granted. Don’t study for that one physics or history or math or English test, but don’t don’t study more than once. Learn from your mistakes. Don’t try to lead the ducks from hyde park back to the hostel, they belong to the queen. Do give Carter free turkeys on the bus (the soccer team knows what I mean). Do make up for missing prom with your friend, even if it is a month later. Make yourself. Make your mistakes. Mess-up. Done Goof. Stay up late. Send yourself to hell, but then survive and come back. Remember, there’s nothing too special about getting hurt, but getting over it, that takes the work. Share your stories of the time you were bailed out by your friend’s scout leader because you were out after curfew. Tell the story of the Kiss with the God of Thunder in the background (for you Sune). Don’t let me tell you what mistakes to avoid because all of your mistakes become part of who you are. So break that window with the Works© bomb. Jump off the roof of your friends house hoping that your hammock parachutes will slow you down before landing on the concrete basketball court. Go to that party and don’t come home until eight A.M. the next day. When you do get home just say “It was fun, I’m tired, I didn’t drink” as you crash on the couch. Make that friend in Spain who is always asking you to join clash of clans even when you don’t want to. Do ask the guy how long he trained to juggle those machetes on top of the lion statue. Talk to the girl at the back of the Globe because you just might go to dinner with her. Live a cool story. Make yourself.</p>
            <p>Wait… scratch that, Make yourself better.</p>

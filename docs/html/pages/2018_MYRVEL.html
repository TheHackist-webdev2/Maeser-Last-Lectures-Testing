            <h1>Day of Love</h1>
            <h5>Myrna Velasco</h5>
            <p>One of the most fascinating concepts of human behavior to me is the fact that we don’t do things other species do to just stay alive, but to feel like we are actually living. The prime example of this is love. The laws of survival tell us we should eat, sleep, keep our species going, and do whatever it takes to not die. If you think about it, love makes us do some things that are out of accordance with these laws. We give up sleep to be on a phone call  with our significant other that has been going for two hours already. We share food with friends even though we were saving that for later. We risk injuries and failure for sports, dance, and art, but we do these things anyway. Love is sacrifice. Love is giving a portion of your life to someone or something willingly.  Love is letting something/someone know you and change you. Love is about caring for something or someone before thinking about yourself. I love the word “falling” in the phrase “falling in love” because it embodies the feeling perfectly. Once you start, it’s really hard to catch yourself or stop; you are subject to obey a force that is out of your control. You can either resist and brace yourself for impact, or you can spread your arms and dive in head first. It also implies that the outcome in unknown; you could be falling on gravel, or you could be falling into a memory foam mush pit of joy. I don’t know about you, but I’m terrified of heights. Falling can be scary, especially when you don’t know how hard you are going to fall or what you are going to land on. But as far away as we try to get from the ledge, our instinct to love brings us back every time. Nature tells us to protect ourselves;, but our humanity tells us to love. It always comes back to it. Our society cannot run without love. Why else would parents work several jobs to provide for their children? Why would children assign themselves responsibilities to care for a creature of a completely different species then cry when it dies or gets lost? Why else would teachers stay long hours, talk through our problems, give us an education, all with relatively small income for hundreds of students who do not belong to them? Why would mothers willingly feel miserable for nine months then risk their lives to bring you here if they did not love you? Whether it is for a person, a sport, a pet, an idea, a hobby, or a profession, everything revolves around love. It is the greatest motivation. I believe iit is the best thing we do.</p>

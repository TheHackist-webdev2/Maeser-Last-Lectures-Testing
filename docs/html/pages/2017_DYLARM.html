            <h5>Dylan Armstrong</h5>
            <p>So you may have heard, I’m graduating next week. I know it’s crazy right. Me of all people. One day and then it’s all over, I never see any of you again. (Well unless you are James Johnson, then you’ve been stuck with me since 2nd grade and I’m living across the street from you at college, so you're never getting rid of me.) What I mean to say is this isn’t working, and no it’s not me, it’s mostly you. It is over. I’m breaking up with you. All of you. (Even you Allyson.) We are never ever getting back together, like ever. I mean we’ve been together for six years… but it’s time to move on. I mean I’m going to college next year, and I don’t want a long distance relationship, it’s time to say goodbye. It’s over, but that doesn’t mean none of it mattered. I’ve learned so much from you, Maeser has taught me how to be me. It’s the end, but the end is just the begining of another journey. I’m sure you’ll find someone else. So since this is goodbye, I wanted to tell you I’m sorry. I’m sorry for all my bad jokes, late assignments, and mistakes that I’ve made. I’ll miss you. I’ll miss the environment a small of high school, the teachers actually knowing my name, and all the friends I made along the way. I forgive you. I forgive you for all the late night assignments, for full dress Monday’s, and for the most stressful years of my life. Finally, I love you. I love you for showing me who I should aim to be, for all the fun I had along the way, and for the best years of my life. Goodbye Maeser, I hope we can still be friends.</p>

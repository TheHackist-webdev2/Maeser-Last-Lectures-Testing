            <h1>High School Eugoogly</h1>
            <h5>Camila Ortega</h5>
            <p>In a few days I’m walking down the aisle. I’m not getting married, but something close to it, I’m marrying adulthood. I’ll leave childhood being completely honest. High school is nothing like High School Musical. Your sibling won’t ever agree to be your singing sidekick, people you love will hurt you and won’t sing you an apology, and people never fall in love over karaoke. But high school has taught me many valuable life lessons; like embracing who and what you love defines you, being happy is always an option, and dropping it too low to apple-bottom jeans when you’re wearing hair extensions is a guaranteed disaster.</p>
            <p>High school can be summarized in the words of a wise man: “We danced and we cried and we laughed and had a really really good time.“ Senior year, however, mostly I just cried. On a crying intensity scale, second semester I was at a Kim Kardashian constantly. That’s because prior to senior year I had the cringe-worthy life motto, YOLO, and an equally cringe-worthy insight that’s actually found in the 2014 yearbook. To quote an experienced, all-knowing fifteen-year-old Camila,</p>
            <q>Sophomore year is great cause you finally know what you’re doing</q>
            <p>Earth to fifteen-year-old Camila. If you know what you’re doing, for starters, maybe do homework before writing a three-page blog post about how fully you love living life, and maybe Clueless is really not worth staying up late to watch for the twenty-fifth time.</p>
            <q>It’s just math. I can totally redo that. Like I may be so stupid at math, but I can definitely do a year’s worth in like two weeks tops.</q>
            <p>Um…  actually, fifteen year-old Camila, you can’t. The problem with procrastination is that it doesn’t seem like a big deal when you’re negotiating with it. It lures you into it’s sketchy white van and lets you watch movies and “find yourself through music” instead of killing you right away.</p>
            <p>I know you’re busy sticking it to the man or whatever by only investing in the classes you think are worth your time, but YOLO is BS. You don’t live once, you live again every day, and thanks to you and your revolutionary life motto, senior year I only slept once.</p>
            <p>Live in the moment, but don’t forget you still have to live tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Or one day you’ll be so happy, just chilling, just doing YOLO, and then bam, the next day they’ll tell you you might not graduate. And your counselors will be like, “No, you’re not being punked. Actually you could potentially be a high school dropout.” And that’s when you’ll realize that if you don’t care, no amount of someone else’s best wishes can save you.</p>
            <p>Through countless all-nighters, weekends where the only people I saw were the crash course brothers, and so much inspirational rap music mom’s spaghetti now means more than just my favorite meal, and just when I started considering living in a box for the rest of my life, I made it out of the pit I’d dug myself into. I achieved the biggest procrastination success of my career. And success really is the best way to stick it to the man. When I finished, Eminem personally wrote me a success rap. It was great, but that success was so expensive, I had to pay for it with my senior year. It cost me so many last-time opportunities, and the ability to give people the best of me.</p> 
            <p>Regret is inevitable, but you can learn. I regret many things, like bleaching off my hair a week before school started, baking revenge laxative cookies, telling that senior boy I knew all about the underground-rap music scene. But I hate regretting selling myself short by not working hard enough, I hate regretting so much misused time because I knew how to do better. In the long run it’s much easier to work hard then to work halfheartedly or selectively. Don’t avoid hard things. They’re not meant to kill you</p>
            <p>Dear fifteen year-old Camila, living life to the fullest isn’t about YOLOing, it’s about how well you fill time. Fill it with people who make you feel warm inside because they’ll listen to your music even when they hate it. Fill it with moments when you feel so alive people question whether you’re sober. Work harder than you think you can and don’t you dare have high expectations without high aspirations.</p>

            <p>Life is like a grocery store. Overhead are tall ceilings and below are floors smudged with skid marks made by the cart with the gimpy wheel. Each aisle sprawls across the building offering something unique: crunchy peanut butter, yogurt, grapes, Fruity Pebbles, Duncan Hines lemon cake mixes, pork knuckles, or whole grain bread. There is something for everyone. That’s the beauty of a grocery store, you choose what you select. Dill or sweet gherkin, Haagen dazs or Ben & Jerry’s, Hershey's or Toblerone, organic or hormone-infused.</p>
            <p>At Maeser, we have a plethora of options in our version of life’s store. We get to pick and choose what we’d like to try. My purchases helped me to grow and change. While perusing the foreign food aisles, a few things sparked my interest -- bratwurst and schnitzel. There was a new arrival, Maeser’s first swim team. I’ve swam since elementary school, but mostly for club and never for my beloved high school. Friends and family urged me to taste it. I hesitantly brought this experience to my lips and tried it. I loved it. Between the seemingly endless, excruciating practices and long car rides to meets were hours of dedication sprinkled with fun. I found joy in swimming again. I paid for my experience with hard work and actual pain, but the feeling of growth and bonding with my team made this selection one I’m grateful I chose.</p>
            <p>The next aisle carried rare and expensive items: caviar, french cheese, imported chocolate. It was full of appetizing and beautiful things attracting my gaze. In my previous trips, I’d browsed the aisle. After checking price tags and ingredients, I would walk away unsure if I was willing to pay such a high price for the experience. A few months ago, I decided I wanted to know if this aisle could offer me a taste of my future. I designed a specific recipe to explore my chosen career path. The price was significant and cost me countless hours of work to plan and carry out a Winterim. As I poured myself into this experience, it wasn’t just about completing the recipe anymore. I saw a future version of myself that combined a rigorous scientific background with patient care. The offerings at Maeser allowed me to see my future and begin to create it.</p>
            <p>Not only are our shopping lists all a little different, but they change over time. You will always have the comfort food you grew fond of in the third grade with your best friend, but you will also find new things to love. You are evolving. When you shop for yourself, it is essential to know what you want. Figuring out who you are is a lifelong process. Sometimes we get stuck in the same routines -- trudging counterclockwise through the aisles, grabbing the produce, bread, eggs, peanut butter, and milk. During the past six years, I have tried new, exotic foods and learned to use the currency of hard work to buy valuable experiences. Selecting from Maeser’s offerings has given me the chance to taste new things and begin to see not just who I am, but who I choose to become.</p>

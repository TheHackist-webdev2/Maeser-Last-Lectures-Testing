            <h1>What Do You Choose</h1>
            <h5>Shaun Cluff</h5>
            <p>I want to talk to you about choices. Let me tell you, you’re going to make a lot of them. Lucky for you though, I am the perfect person to give advice about this, because I am an Expert at making bad choices. At this point, you really start to think about all of the decisions you have made that have culminated to this moment. I remember as a sophomore I CHOSE to stay up till 2 am memorizing a monologue that I had procrastinated for a long time. In 9th grade I CHOSE to throw a pencil in 7th period biology that somehow ended up hitting Mr. Kreitzer in the forehead, earning me a trip to Mrs. Ellis’s office. Even this year I CHOSE to give Mrs. Macduff a heart attack when I almost got ran over in London. You see, these choices are  probably not the best, but there are some decisions I made with my education here at Maeser that I actually deeply regret. Choices that held me back from my potential. But Regret is not what got me here today. What I have learned at Maeser is how to make the right choices (most of the time, i’m still learning), and I hope that you can come to that same realization faster than I did.</p>
            <p>You are attending Karl G. Maeser Preparatory Academy, the number one high school in Utah. There is a reason for that. You are receiving the best education, from the best teachers, in the best ways. Also, Winterim, Socratic, and all the other aspects of our school that make Maeser Maeser. You have been given the opportunity of a lifetime here, so what you do with it is absolutely critical. You’re going to make choices that will either lead you down the wrong path or the right one. (For example, some of you choose to put popcorn in the microwave and cook it so long that it fills our tiny school with a horrendous smell. That is a BAD choice).</p>
            <p>Last year, I made the wrong choices. I got distracted. I didn’t prioritize what was important in my life, and I fell behind. I was failing in classes, and making myself ineligible for two major scholarships. I chose to procrastinate, to be lazy, and to simply not care about my academics. These choices snowballed into what turned out to be the most horrible year of my life. If I had known about how important these decisions were, like I do now, I might not have gotten myself into that situation. Luckily, I had help, and you do too. This is Maeser, and I can tell you for a fact that no matter who you are, there is someone who cares about you. Whether that is a friend, teacher, or counselor, there is a person that will help you when you do make that wrong choice. I messed up, but I learned from it, and now I have the opportunity to go to college with scholarships and make my dreams come true.</p>
            <p>I recovered from my stumble, but I still know I could be so much better had I made the choice earlier to focus hard on my experience at Maeser and be focused on the end goal. I don’t want you to have that same regret. Make those small choices now. Turn in your homework on time. Study hard for your tests. Don’t be late to class. It’s a big deal that you are here, so treat Maeser how Maeser treats you.</p>
            <p>Quoting my favorite book of all time: “Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter, tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further…. And one fine morning--- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past”</p>
            <p>Sometimes it’s gonna feel like you’re rowing against the current, but just keep going Maeser. Make the right choices. Don’t waste the blessing you have been given here. Work hard, and tomorrow you will run faster, and stretch out your arms further. You’ll get there.</p>

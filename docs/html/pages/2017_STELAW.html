            <h1>My Crowning Glory</h1>
            <h5>Steven Lawrence</h5>
            <p>For the first half of high school I was a straight A, shyer than shy, kid. I spent most of my time playing video games and doing what it took to get straight A’s in school. Each morning after eating breakfast I would lay in bed wondering why I should get in the shower to go to school. This would happen until I became so stressed about what might happen if I were to miss a day of school that I would end up getting in the shower and going to school. I was miserable. But this misery motivated me to change. I decided to start getting involved in extracurricular activities. I joined science olympiad, math team, and tennis, even though I was the worst player on the team; I lost every match. I worried less about school and focused more on my happiness by spending more time with family and friends and seizing opportunities to serve. Once I went to a college party with a friend who attended BYU because it was her birthday. The next day I had a project due for physics and I did terrible on it. As a general rule, you should try to get your homework done before you party but don’t let it get in the way of family, friends, and serving those who need help. Education is important but your happiness is the reason for your existence.</p>
            <p>When I started high school I never would’ve thought my literal crowning moment would be receiving a bouquet of flowers for raising my eyebrows and wearing an excessive amount of black clothing.</p>
            <p>An hour after I wrote my name on Mr. Simmon’s door to participate in Mr. Maeser I was sitting in Socratic when someone yelled across the room,</p>
            <q>Steven! You’re doing Mr. Maeser?!</q>
            <p><q>Yes??????????”</q> I responded.</p>
            <p>Am I Mr. Maeser material? I thought. I know I can be funny, but am I the kind of person who can stand in front of a crowd, make a fool of myself, and entertain them? My shyness levels are just shy of shy guy. After I had signed up there were at least a dozen times I thought of not going through with it, but the thought of making someone laugh kept me in it because laughter is the best medicine, at least until your doctor recommends something else.</p>
            <p>I did pretty good. Then I won. So at least the 3 judges thought I was funny along with my fam section. I never expected to win. It was one of those moments that was never planned for but ended up being better than any preconceived scenario. I felt like I slayed a dragon. The dragon of social inhibition. It was an incredible moment that made me realize how far I’d come. I was always too scared to talk to people. This left me I miserable and alone. At times I even wondered if people knew I was there. Then I dared to try new things like tennis, cross country, and Mr. Maeser. Even though I failed at a majority of those I had fun experiences and not so fun experiences where I learned.</p>
            <p>Don’t be afraid of doing what you want to do. You have the potential to do great things. Don’t be afraid of failure. You will fail many times but as long as you keep trying you will succeed.</p>

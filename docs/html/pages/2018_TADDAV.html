            <h1>Playing for the Team</h1>
            <h5>Tade Davis</h5>
            <p>The world outside suddenly silenced. Salty beads of sweat zigged and zagged past my nose and toward the ground as I gasped for air, head in between my knees. This was it, the fourth quarter, trailing by two. Derek Smith approached the line the line to attempt his second free throw. 8.5 on the clock. It was time for the Tade show.</p>
            <p>Lowered in my stance, I watched the ball clank off the back off the rim, and drowned out by cheers from behind, the great Tade Davis came down with the rock. Show time.</p>
            <p>“Race down the floor. Check. Kick it to Taylor Brand. Check. Weave to the opposite wing. Check. Square your feet toward the basket. Check.” Triumphant, I glanced up in time to watch Taylor release the ball in my general direction. “Extend, catch, rise up and release. Extend catch rise up and...” the ball was just out of my reach.</p>
            <p>Despair.</p>
            <p>It became apparent the ball was never going to reach me. As it soared just past my fingertips, all my hard work seemed to be flushed away. I couldn’t help but feel like all those hours in the gym and all those sessions of film were for naught. This was my moment, and I was going to miss it because Taylor through an ill-advised pass.</p>
            <p>As I began to hang my head, the ball found a home in the hands of the seldom used marksman Dillon, who was streaking down the floor. As the horn sounded I saw the ball glide through the air, beautifully kiss off the glass, and snap the net back as it passed through.</p>
            <p>Ecstasy.</p>
            <p>I couldn’t help but shove him over. In an instant, all the hours in the gym had been reclaimed by a miraculous jump shot. It all had meaning again. All the hard work as a team led to Dillon making that shot.</p>
            <p>My message is as simple as it is sweet. The world doesn’t revolve around you. Quit begging it to you. Not every assignment is tailored to help you pass the test. Get over it. Not every test is going to challenge you. Move on. Not everything is made to make you a star. It’s there to better the team.</p>
            <p>Someone in the class needed that handout to pass. Another guy read that story and found understanding. The girl sitting next to you got an “A” on that test and has never be more proud.</p>
            <p>Not every assignment you do in class is going to prepare you for life. Not every drill you run in practice it to prepare you for the limelight. But it’s there for someone. So how about helping them out?</p>
            <p>No matter how many three pointers I made, shots I blocked, “and-ones” I finished, that shot against Delta will always stand out as the defining moment in my basketball career. Because It taught me that the only thing better than being a hero, is being a team player.</p>

            <h1>Human</h1>
            <h5>James Han</h5>
            <p>Can we talk? I need to tell you something. Before I do, I just want to let you know that this is my deepest and darkest secret. I hope this doesn’t change the way you see me, but I feel the need to inform you more about my life. I’m a fish. I know, I know, you’re probably thinking, “James, you’re not a fish! You’re crazy.”Yes, I am a little crazy, but I promise, I am a fish. As a little kid my dad would frequently smile at me, place his hand on my shoulder, and cheer, “Son, you can be anything you want to be.” The thing is, I never chose to be a fish. The fish life chose me. Before freshman year of high school started, I created a mantra: I want to be a human! I want two legs that can run for miles, and walk for hundreds. Arms that can wiggle, dangle, and maybe even slap people when needed. And so that was my goal. The only way I was going to survive high school was to become a human. I created such a realistic human costume that none of my friends even suspected that I was a fish. I put my costume on every morning, lifted my head high, and played the part of a human. If I acted long enough, I figured that eventually I would just become one.</p>
            <p>That never happened.</p>
            <p>After school was over, I would trudge home and zip off the heavy costume. Frustrated, I would lay motionless on my bed and cry. In a whole colony of humans, I was certain that I was alone. The routine was exhausting. One night, I realized that being a human isn’t worth the effort. Why walk the walk and talk the talk, when you can swim the swim and gurgle the gurgle?</p>
            <p>I started to love who I really was. All desire to become a human disappeared and I was happy. My new mantra became the words from my favorite fish: “Just keep swimming.” And I did just that.</p>
            <p>Eventually, I collected the courage to tell one of my human acquaintances that I was a fish. My fins were moist and my thoughts were scattered. She’s pescetarian. She’ll hate me! Everyone is going to hate me. I did it anyway. A little hatred will never stop me from being what I truly am. I zipped my costume off in front of her and tossed it to the ground. My scales shimmered and I was proud of my skin. I waited for a response and to my surprise, she didn’t spit in my face. She didn’t make fun of me. She started to cry. She smiled and started to unzip her own costume which slivered to the ground revealing her true identity: a potato.</p>
            <p>For the first time in my life, all the loneliness and despair escaped my breath. Even though she wasn’t another fish, I understood all the pain she had gone through. The acting, the tears, the costumes. As high school advanced, I had more opportunities to reveal my true identity. In return, I was able to take a glimpse of all the other beautiful lives I am surrounded with. I am best friends with turtles, dogs, bears, cats, even a banana. Each and every one of these beautiful souls have shaped me into a better fish. They constantly teach me that everybody is a work of art.</p>
            <p>I can swim faster than ever before. I enjoy the rush of water against my shiny scales. I admire the funny gills that help me breathe. Taking off that stupid costume saved my life. I survived high school because I let myself be true to myself. You are a magnificent creature. Whatever you are, don’t be afraid to zip off your costume. Chances are, the people around you are wearing one too.</p>

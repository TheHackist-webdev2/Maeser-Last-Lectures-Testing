            <h1>Work, Time and Laughter</h1>
            <h5>Kendall Bailey</h5>
            <p>It’s not possible to sum up six years of lessons and experience in only seven hundred and fifty words. Trust me, I’ve tried. But I can share a few things I have learned.</p>
            <p>Being on the cross country team my junior and senior year was definitely a way I learned and grew. It felt like I was a part of a family. That’s what happens when you spend hours at practice and meets together, when the jokes flow freely, when you run, sweat, breathe, and collapse together. We crunched. We sprinted. We did hills. We cheered each other to the finish line. We waited to use the one seater in a tiny grocery store called Workman’s Market in Helper, Utah. We chanted “Run with purpose. Run with pride. Rise up it’s Lion’s time. RAWR!” for the first few hundred yards of a race we were late to. I don’t remember any of my times from any of my races. The pain I felt while running has blurred into a hazy memory. But I do remember my teammates. The cross country team taught me to laugh no matter what. Even when the bus is on one side of the mountain and the meet you are supposed to be running in is on the other.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hults was in a motorcycle accident in the middle of March, which just happened to be the middle of rehearsals for Much Ado About Nothing. As stage manager, I kept rehearsal going, mostly because I didn’t know what else to do. A week later, Ms. Gerber and Ms. Smith stepped in to get the show to the stage, er, gym floor. But it wasn’t just them. We kept thinking of more people we needed to thank. As Ms. Gerber says, “This show took a village.” The cast did nine hour rehearsals, parents brought us food, the production class painted the set, and on and on. Every single day, I could count on getting at least one hug from a cast member. We banded together and I am so grateful for the cast and the story they told on stage. From the cast and others involved with Much Ado, I learned anything is possible when you come together to accomplish a goal.</p>
            <p>I have either had a class or done a show with Ms. Gerber every single year for the six years I have been here: middle school drama, The Wiz, world history, Print Comm, Broadway Rocks, and Much Ado. I was an editor in Print Comm as a sophomore. I had a solo in Broadway Rocks last year and this year, I directed a number. If you ask her, she will say I am the reason Much Ado made it to the stage. I disagree for the simple reason that I was just doing what I would have done anyway. Each of these experiences with Ms. Gerber has built my confidence because I know she trusts me and has confidence in my abilities.</p>
            <p>I would feel very very guilty if I spent an entire speech talking about friendships and didn’t talk about two people who have become my best friends. My brothers. Every morning driving to school, laughing, sharing stories, sometimes fuming because we are running late. Visiting Pioneer Book just because Clark wanted to look around. Being on the cross country team together. Trying to get Carson to laugh really hard because I love the way it sounds. Late nights in the living room pretending to be doing homework. Teasing about crushes. Going to basketball and soccer games. Discussing Socratic readings. I’m going to miss you. You taught me the importance of listening to others and loving them unconditionally. Thanks for loving this prickly pear.</p>
            <p>Don’t let the opportunity to build relationships pass you by. Loneliness is the worst. And the only way to combat it is to stop moping in your bedroom, get off your high horse and go talk to people. Surviving high school takes people. So go find yours. And when you do, wrap them up in a blanket and hold them close to you for as long as you can. Take selfies because I promise you won’t remember the funny, goofy things unless you record them. Friendships take work, time and laughter. They take a willingness to look a little bit stupid. But the good friends, the ones worth keeping, are the ones who laugh at your stupidity, then give you a hug, help you fix it and keep going together.</p>

            <h1>Fear</h1>
            <h5>Sarah Sorenson</h5>
            <p>Your heart beats faster than a galloping horse’s hooves, a rhythm so intense you can feel it pulsing from within your skull. Fictional characters always seem to worry about whoever is pursuing them being able to hear the frantic thumps, but no author can capture the sheer strength and volume of a heart that fears it may soon stop pumping. The rest of your body seems to get the message quite quickly and a shiver makes its way down your spine; eyes widen and hands begin to tremble as you realize what exactly has caused this involuntary response. You try to turn and run, but you soon understand what it means to be paralyzed by fear. You’ve become helpless in the face of this monstrosity, and your frozen body has left you completely at its mercy. Time seems to go faster and slower simultaneously, and it feels like you’re just there to watch. It doesn’t really matter what you insert into this, whether it be spiders, mind numbingly high drops, or clowns. Fear is fear, and it is an immensely powerful emotion. In Yann Martel’s Life of Pi, it is accurately described less as an irrational feeling and more as the rival of life. Fear is life’s true opponent because it begins in the mind, it can take control of people’s lives, and it is more powerful than death.</p>
            <p>The brain is the control center for your entire body. It is responsible for cognitive thoughts, feelings, movement, balance, and basically everything else that goes on inside of a human. The mind is also, unfortunately, the place where fear is created and is able to take root. Most people’s minds rely heavily on information received through the senses, which can make it very easy to deceive. Fear “Goes for your weakest spot, which it finds with unerring ease. It begins in your mind, always”(Martel 161). This does not mean that all of our fears are born from deception; on the contrary, many fears were developed to keep people alive and safe. It is when the fear overwhelms us that a problem develops. In Life of Pi, Pi’s fears near the beginning of the book are overwhelming- with the boat he’s aboard sinking and being unable to reach his family. His fear is so overwhelming that his “Mind could hardly conceive it. It was as unbelievable as the moon catching fire”(Martel 103). This is the type of fear that earns itself the title of the true opponent of life. It is the heartstopping seconds of a heart monitors’ flat note or the moments following a devastating disaster during which the brain refuses to allow the personality to think beyond basic survival needs. These few moments may not mean death physically, but they can cause people to decay emotionally, spiritually, and psychologically. This fear challenges life in a way that nothing else, not even death, can. It is always there haunting, lying in wait like a predator poised to strike, “For fear, real fear such as shakes you to your foundation, such as you feel when you are brought face to face with your mortal end, nestles in your memory like a gangrene: it seeks to rot everything”(Martel 162). Fear is one of the ultimate threats to life because it is created and can become deeply rooted in the mind.</p>
            <p>If unchecked, a person's fears may grow to the point where they are no longer able to control them. Rather, they will end up being controlled by them. The media loves to highlight extreme cases of this, such as a young married couple having a zombie apocalypse bunker in their basement or groups of individuals wearing tin foil hats to prevent an alien abduction. While these are good examples of letting fear control your life, it does not always have to be in this way that lives are taken over. Fear doesn’t have to come from one specific source either. Pi, for example, suffered from many fears that were sometimes hard to distinguish. He wasn’t scared about specific parts of the events he went through, he was traumatized by the entire experience. The fear took control of his life in a different manner than it did in the aforementioned examples. Instead, Pi suffered through “Fits of fearful trembling. Precisely where [he] wanted to be the most still– [his] legs– [were] where [he] trembled the most. [His] legs drummed upon the tarpaulin…. The trembling spread to [his] arms and it was all [he] could do to hold on. Each fit passed”(Martel 108). He had no control over himself during these episodes. It was almost as if he were a rag doll to his fear, with no choice but to let it shake him about until he was able to control it once more. This is not the only way fear takes control of Pi’s life throughout this story. Pi describes how taxing it was on him religiously when he tried to find hope in what he had, but couldn’t see past the bad. He tried to believe that he was going to be ok because everything he had didn’t belong to him, “But God’s hat was always unraveling. God’s pants were falling apart. God’s cat was a constant danger. God’s ark was a jail. God’s wide acres were slowly killing me. God’s ear didn’t seem to be listening”(Martel 209). One of the greatest fears that many people don’t even know they have is the fear of being abandoned, especially by their God, and Pi’s fear of everything that is happening to him distorts the way he views the world until he can no longer find God’s hand in his life. Pi’s spiritual life was being sucked dry by his fear, and even became a source of fear itself. Fear is able to fight against life because of how its able to overtake people’s existence.</p>
            <p>“I’m too young to die” is a phrase commonly used at comical points in movies, TV shows, or books. The real question is, is the character saying this implying that they are too young for death or for the fear of death that has gripped their bones? Truthfully, fear can be more powerful than death. In many religions, even the mix that Pi has created for himself, death is seen as a release from this mortal existence. If you were a good person in life, you would be heading to some paradise to spend the rest of your time in peace. Seen from this point of view, death is almost a good thing, relief from whatever pains you were suffering from on earth. Fear is much less forgiving. In fact, Pi contemplates on how “Only fear can defeat life. It is a clever, treacherous adversary,” and going on about how “It has no decency, respects no law or convention, shows no mercy”(Martel 161). Death is peaceful and inevitable, while fear is hostile and seemingly avoidable. Even though many people believe that death is the thing that destroys life, in many ways it also brings it. Life and death are both part of the life cycle, so death is a part of life-fear, however, works against this harmonious cycle. The fear of death becomes worse than death itself, and suddenly paranoid people are refusing to leave the house or live their lives because they fear something will happen that will send them to an early grave. This is not to say that all fears should be completely disregarded, because fears should be conquered rather than pushed aside. Many fears have a piece of truth within that helps when it comes to survival. Fears have their time and place, just like any other emotion, and they cannot be avoided entirely because “If your fear becomes a worthless darkness that you avoid, perhaps even manage to forget, you open yourself to further attacks of fear because you never truly fought the opponent who defeated you”(Martel 162). Fear is an extremely powerful emotion, and pushing it away will only bring about more consequences later. It is the rival of life because it more powerful than death.</p>
            <p>Fear is not always a bad thing- fear of heights keeps people from getting too close to an edge and fear of spiders or snakes keeps others from being bitten by any poisonous species. It is a bad thing when it becomes so overwhelming that it takes away from the life of whoever is experiencing it. Fear is powerful enough to be life’s true opponent because it comes from and grows in the human mind, it can take away and overpower the lives of those who experience it, and it holds more power over us than even death does.</p>

            <h1>Doing Things</h1>
            <h5>Bennet Felstead</h5>
            <p>Charles Darwin once said “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change”. Now, while Charlie Darwin never actually said that, I still think it’s a good point. The most important thing that I learned from going to high school, was how to accustom myself to different situations, or as a normal person would say, how to adapt. One of the major things that I had to adapt to was to, as I eloquently put it, do things. Let me explain. I don’t mean the typical ‘go to every single thing ever and do all that you can always at the school’. I mean that I needed to start breaking the habit of not doing what I was supposed to do. I feel like we have all been in that situation, when you need to do some big project and instead of doing it early, you wait until that last second just to, you know, make your brain have a panic attack. I remember I had a physics project where we had to build a mousetrap car. It was due on thursday, so naturally I was going to wait until wednesday night to start it. But, this is when I realized that procrastination is an evil thing. I woke up monday, went to school, only to realize that the car was due that day… I failed that class. Now, realizing that procrastination is a bad thing is very different from actually doing something about your procrastination. It’s very hard to switch from something you’ve been doing for so long. But trust me, it’s worth the effort.</p>
            <p>Now, that’s not everything I meant from “doing things.” Another part of that idea is literally doing things. More of things that you usually wouldn’t do. If you told me when I started 11th grade that I would be bidding on a chair for three hundred dollars that year, I would say “Go away, I don’t know you.” But I’d also not believe you. But lo and behold, that year at the service auction, I wasn’t about to let the seniors take that chair away from me. Now, spending extraordinary amounts on chairs is not something that I was known for before that, but I decided to do something. Again, this year. No idea that I’d spend almost two hundred dollars on carmel, but again, I surprised myself. I also went to a few dances, which is usually out of my comfort zone, but it was fun. These are examples of doing things. I think it’s important. Now, I’m not saying that everyone should spend huge amounts of money on random objects, but I am saying that you should be doing things that are worthwhile. Make some memories.</p>
            <p>Back to the adapting thing, one thing that I had to adapt to was myself. Whoever said that you could be yourself and nothing could go wrong was a liar. Because when I’m being stupid with my friends and making dumb noises, it’s funny. But suddenly, when I’m doing it in the middle of a test, it’s “inappropriate” and “not funny” and “Stop it Bennett, you're annoying”. I’ve learned that I have to make small changes. If I’m talking to a quiet person, somewhat of an introvert, I’m not gonna make them as uncomfortable as possible and basically shout at them. I’ve learned that I need to change a little bit. I need to change my mindset at moments. I can’t go into math with the same mindset I do as when I go into socratic. And I think that is important to know. So, what can I tell you future maeser… people? I can tell you to adapt. I’m not saying to completely change who you are, as that’s absurd, but just understand that there is a time and place for everything. Thank you.</p>

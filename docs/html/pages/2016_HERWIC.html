            <p>“Pull up in a monster automobile gangster with a bad bish that came from Sri Lanka yeah I’m in the tanka color of Willie Wonka you can be the king but watch the queen conquer. First thing first I eat your brain, I’m start rocking gold teeth and fangs cause that’s what a motherloving monster do hairdresser from Milan is the monster shoe.”</p>
            <p>You might be thinking what the freak I just said and why the freak am I rapping a crazy Nicki Minaj verse. Well I’m just being myself. I love Nicki Minaj and I wish I could rap and I tried.</p>
            <p>Well you must be super confused about what I’m doing and why I started my speech with a rap. Well my speech is about being yourself and discovering who you are. I know “Be yourself and enjoy life” is one of the most common phrases used and spoken about when it comes to Last Lecture essays and mine is more of the same, so suck it up and listen.</p>
            <p>Aristotle once said, “Know thyself.” The meaning of this phrase refers to the awareness of your thoughts, actions, habits and your behavior. To me it means self discovery. To discover yourself, you have to be yourself. The more you know yourself, the better you will be able to understand humanity.</p>
            <p>Many of you may humor me and tell me, “Dude I already know who I am.” But to be honest you really don’t know who you are. You may be surprised by what kind of person you become under different circumstances. You may also ask me how can I discover myself? Well, that is what I am here to tell you.</p> 
            <p>To discover yourself the first thing you need to do is isolate yourself from all technology and all comforts and go into the woods and live with all the animals and bugs. That is the right way. Ha ha JK. No, that is not the right way to discover yourself. And the right way is that there is no right way. There is no correct way. Everyone will have different ways they prefer, but there are certain things that have to be done before you know who you truly are.</p>
            <p>The first important step is to awaken your conscience. Try thinking and writing down all your goals and the goals you have achieved and want to achieve. It might also help if you list all your problems and obstacles in your way of reaching your goals. This is not an excuse, or wallowing, it is about identification and clarification of your issues.</p>
            <p>The next thing you need to do is try to distinguish your thoughts from the thoughts of others. You may think your opinion on a certain matter may be yours, but it may actually be the opinion of someone else. To be yourself, you need to identify your own opinions and your own thoughts so you can have an idea what your morals and standards are. It may take some time to distinguish your thoughts, and personally, when I tried doing this same thing, I realized that many of my opinions and thoughts are not exactly mine. They were either established by my parents or my other loved ones. Bare in mind that, even though your thoughts may differ from those of others, it does not matter because your thoughts and opinions make you. They define you. The best way to achieve this is to question your every thought and understand what makes it unique. Questioning your thoughts is a critical aspect of self discovery because without your questions you won’t know why you think the way you do.</p>
            <p>So now you have a slight idea how to discover yourself and how to be your true self. If people don’t accept who you really are, forget about them, move on, and find new friends who will let you be yourself. Afterwards life will be full of joy and happy memories. My friends accept me for who I am. They know I am a huge Beyonce and Nicki Minaj fan, and they also know that if I have any kind of caffeine or sugar I break out into song and make a fool out of myself. But the best thing is, they don’t judge me. They either join me or stand aside cheering me on.</p>
            <p>You need to find some friends who will help you live to the maximum potential you can.
            <p>So now be yourself and enjoy life. 
            <p>No, but seriously, go and enjoy life by being yourself.  And by choosing the right friends.

            <h1>Life Before Death, Strength before Weakness, Journey Before Destination</h1>
            <h5>Taylor LaFranca</h5>
            <p>Life before death, fairly obvious right? I mean, we are living before we’re dead, so why is it important to say? Before I came to Maeser I had a life, but I wasn’t living it. Back in my old school, I was bullied and pushed around because I didn’t fit in. I was treated differently because I wasn’t who they wanted me to be. The phrase life before death means that we need to look at our lives, evaluate ourselves, and decide. “Am I really living my life?” I’ve been there, I know what it’s like to be alive, but not really living and I’m here to tell you, live your life, do what you want to do, not just what others expect you to do.</p>
            <p>Strength before weakness. Again, another weird phrase right? When I was in Ninth grade I had a decision to make. I was in my first year at Maeser, new school, new people, I had a chance to restart. A chance to be who I wanted to be. It was the turning point in my life. I had to take out the things that were making me weak and become strong again. It was time for me to stand up, and be proud of what made me different. So what if I memorized practically everything about Bionicle? So what if I made a habit of studying Dragons and learning about them? That’s what I love about Maeser, we can be who we want to be. We bring out the strengths in each other. At Maeser, strength is put before weakness. We strive to learn, be better, and treat others the way we want to be treated.</p>
            <p>Journey before Destination, this hit me as obvious. At least, it did at first. The more I thought about it, the deeper it got. We all have a destination in mind, where we want to go, what we want to be, but there’s one thing in the way, the journey. Grade School, middle school, high school, are all just part of the journey. They shape us, the people we meet, the classes we take, how we choose to act. All of this is part of our journey. While my journey at Maeser is coming to a close, yours is still under way. Embrace the parts of you that define you, regardless of what others say. There’s another quote that I love, “Just be yourself, everyone else is already taken”. I’ve gone down the whole ‘be who others want me to be’ path and I wasn’t happy. When I made new friends at Maeser, friends who accepted me for who I was; an incredibly nerdy,  Dragon loving, Arthurian wannabe, pun-making master, I found who I wanted to be. My challenge to all  of you is to find who you want to be and just do it.</p>
            <p>Life before death, follow the path you choose, live it, so that on the day you look back at your life, you can do so happily.</p>
            <p>Strength before weakness, acknowledge your strengths before your weaknesses. Focus on them, and make your strengths stronger, then, turn your weakness into a strength.</p>
            <p>Journey before destination, Choose to be yourself on your journey and once you arrive at your destination, you will know who you are and be proud of it.</p>
